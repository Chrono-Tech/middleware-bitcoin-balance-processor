Middleware service for handling user balance

### Installation

This module is a part of middleware services. You can install it in 2 ways:

1) through core middleware installer  [middleware installer](https://github.com/ChronoBank/middleware-bitcoin)
2) by hands: just clone the repo, do 'npm install', set your .env - and you are ready to go

##### About
This module is used for updating balances for registered accounts.


#### rabbitmq events

Rabbitmq is used for 2 main reasons - the first one for inner communication between different core modules. And the second one - is for notification purpose. When block is being updated, the user get a notfication through an exchange called 'events' with routing key:

```
<rabbitmq_service_name>_balance.{address}
```
Where address is to or from address (and default rabbitmq_service_name=bitcoin).

This middleware get two type events from middleware bitcoin-block-processor

Input events:

| name queue | format message |
| ------ | ------- | 
| ``` <rabbitmq_service_name>_transaction.* ``` | ``` {address: <String>, block: <String>, txs: [<String>]} ```
| ``` <rabbitmq_service_name>_block ``` | ``` {block: <String>} ```

Output events:

| name queue | format message | example |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| ``` <rabbitmq_service_name>_balance.{address} ``` | ``` {address: <String>, balances: {confirmations0: <Number>, confirmations3: <Number>, confirmations6: <Number> }, tx: <String>} ``` | ``` { address: 'RUpuMAB1qLZK2ptV43kxMU5kcvyLogdx8R', balances: { confirmations0: 14999986960, confirmations3: 5000000000, confirmations6: 0 }, tx: '0db07f3ec23ee5f56aee88029fdb5d7284d3078c8b433eac157a075f8d8d842c' } ```
